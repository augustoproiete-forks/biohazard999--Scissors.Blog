This year was kind of a up an down for me, literally.

So let's have a look what happened this year.

1. I was working as a consultant earlier this year, wrote a lot posts the first quarter of the year, and was looking for a job in Graz to get a more stable income.
2. I started my pateron! This was/is well received, and I have to apologize to all my backers. This year did start very promising, but later on I lost track of writing. More about that later.
3. I [joined Ranorex]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-29-I-am-joining-ranorex %})!
4. I've got a working demo of my [XAF-Desktop-Bridge]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-15-how-to-use-the-desktop-bridge-to-create-an-appx-package-for-xaf %}) into the [Windows store](//www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/scissorsfeaturecenter/9n7lszbmn8vb). I was working on a blog post about this, but never published it so f[ar, cause it was quite tedious and I lost track of all the steps I needed to go trough. But maybe thats a task for next year. If anybody is interested, let me know in the comments!


Now stuff is getting hard for me to write, but I'll try anyway.
